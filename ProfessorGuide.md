## 3. How to Edit Your Information

### A. Publications
**File:** `src/datasets/pblcDataset.ts`

#### To Add a Publication
1. Open the file in your editor.
2. Find the list that looks like this:
   ```ts
   const publicationsData: Publication[] = [
     {
       id: 1,
       type: "journal",
       title: "...",
       authors: ["...", "..."],
       year: 2024,
       venue: "...",
       impact: "...",
       doi: "..."
     },
     // ... more publications
   ];
   ```
3. Copy an existing publication (from `{` to `},`), paste it below, and change the details. Make sure the `id` is unique (add 1 to the highest number).

#### To Edit a Publication
- Change the text inside the relevant entry (e.g., update the title, authors, year, etc.).

#### To Delete a Publication
- Remove the entire entry (from `{` to `},`).

#### Example
```ts
{
  id: 99,
  type: "journal",
  title: "My New Research Paper",
  authors: ["A. Sadeghi-Niaraki", "J. Smith"],
  year: 2025,
