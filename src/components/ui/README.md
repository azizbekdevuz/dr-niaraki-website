# UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)

This folder contains generic, reusable UI elements (not tied to a specific feature).

## Files
- **LoadingScreen.tsx** â€” Full-page loading indicator with animation and progress.

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Add new generic UI components as needed.
- **Edit:** Update the relevant file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Keep UI components generic and reusable.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
