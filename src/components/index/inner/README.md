# Inner Components (`src/components/index/inner/`)

This folder contains shared or nested components used in the landing/about pages.

## Files
- **VideoS.tsx** — Video section/component.
- **InteractiveCard.tsx** — Interactive card UI.
- **MobileMenu.tsx** — Mobile menu overlay.
- **MenuOverlay.tsx** — Overlay for menus.

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Add new shared/nested components as needed.
- **Edit:** Update the relevant file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
