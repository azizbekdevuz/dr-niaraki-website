# Index Components (`src/components/index/`)

This folder contains components for the main landing page, about page, and related sections.

## Structure
- **aboutSection/** — Components for the About section/page (see its README)
- **inner/** — Shared/nested components for landing/about (see its README)
- Other files — MainContent, Contact, TeachingExperience, etc.

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Place new components in the most relevant subfolder or at the root if it's a main section.
- **Edit:** Update the relevant file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Keep components modular and focused.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
- See subfolder READMEs for more details.
