# About Section Components (`src/components/index/aboutSection/`)

This folder contains components and data for the About page/section.

## Files
- **Components.tsx** — Main About section UI and logic.
- **dataComponents.tsx** — Data and helper components for About section.

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Add new section components or data as needed.
- **Edit:** Update the relevant file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Keep About-specific logic and UI here.
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
