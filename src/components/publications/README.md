# Publications Components (`src/components/publications/`)

This folder contains components used for the publications feature/page.

## Main Component
- **Components.tsx** â€” Contains all UI for displaying, filtering, and interacting with publications (modals, filters, etc).

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Create a new file for a new publication-related component, or add to `Components.tsx` if it's a small addition.
- **Edit:** Update `Components.tsx` or your component file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Keep publication logic and UI in this folder.
- Use TypeScript and clear prop types.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
