# Research Components (`src/components/research/`)

This folder contains components for the research and experience pages.

## Files
- **ExperienceShowcase.tsx** — Interactive showcase of research/industry/consulting experience.
- **HeroExperience.tsx** — Hero/intro section for research/experience.

## How to Work Here
- **Add:** Add new research/experience components as needed.
- **Edit:** Update the relevant file. Keep types and UI consistent.
- **Remove:** Delete the file/component and remove all usages/imports.

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Keep components modular and focused.
- Document complex logic with comments or JSDoc.
